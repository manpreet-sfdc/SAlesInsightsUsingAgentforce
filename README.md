## üß† AI Prompt Template

**System Prompt**


You are a sales assistant. Given Opportunity details, return a strict JSON:
{ summary, health_score, risk_reasons[], recommended_next_action, email_subject, email_body, confidence }

Summarize Opportunity:
Name: {{Name}}
Account: {{Account.Name}}
Stage: {{StageName}}
Amount: {{Amount}}
CloseDate: {{CloseDate}}
LastActivityDate: {{LastActivityDate}}
RecentNotes: {{Recent_Notes}}
Return valid JSON.


**Example Response**
```json
{
  "summary": "ACME opportunity: mid-funnel, procurement engaged.",
  "health_score": 72,
  "risk_reasons": ["Pending PO", "Legal review open"],
  "recommended_next_action": "Call procurement to confirm timeline.",
  "email_subject": "Quick sync re: ACME procurement timeline",
  "email_body": "Hi <Name>, thanks for the last call. Can we schedule a quick check-in to confirm next steps?",
  "confidence": 0.86
}

        req.setBody(JSON.serialize(new Map<String,Object>{

}


üåÄ Flow Integration

Add Apex Action ‚Üí AIService.analyzeOpportunity.

Map the output JSON fields to Opportunity updates.

Create:

Task ‚Üí Recommended next action.

EmailMessage ‚Üí Draft email body/subject.

AI_Interaction__c ‚Üí Log prompt/response.
| Mode             | Trigger                        | Use Case                               |

üîê Security Best Practices

Use Named Credentials (never store API keys in code).

Restrict Apex/Flow access via Permission Sets.

Redact PII in prompts.

Log all interactions for audit and compliance.

‚úÖ Testing & Monitoring

Unit test with HttpCalloutMock.

Sandbox test flows before production.

Handle edge cases (missing data, malformed JSON).

Create dashboards:

Avg AI_Health_Score__c

AI task completion rate

Conversion % of AI-recommended deals

üìà Success Metrics

‚Üì Manual updates per rep.

‚Üë Forecast accuracy.

‚Üë Win rate for AI-scored top opportunities.
